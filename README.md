# Configuration Manager

The Configuration Manager will read in arbitrary JSON and YAML configuration
files and present data entry fields allowing users to update the configuration
without the need to open the files in an editor and modify the configuration
settings directly.

## Configuration

The Configuration Manager is driven by the ```config_manager.yaml``` configuration
file. This drives which files are loaded for review and modification.
